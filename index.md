## COURSE DESCRIPTION

The World Wide Web is a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards and extended into media posting and sharing. With the rise of broadband, more powerful computers, always on and connected mobile devices, synchronous or live communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conferencing and real-time chat give us the ability to create new forms of live interactive experiences for participants.

In this course, we’ll focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through web based and live interactive technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation. Specifically, we’ll look at new and emerging platforms on the web such as HTML5, WebSockets and WebRTC using p5.js, JavaScript and Node.js.

### Course Objectives

1.  Effectively build creative web applications that include working with real-time media
2.  Learn how to think about web application and real-time media system design as well as algorithmically; understand the process of breaking a task into discrete steps that a computer and/or user may employ to complete it.
3.  Think critically about the role of online media and technology in shaping individuals and society.

## DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND LEARNING MODES

Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and require different kinds of accommodations. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you in any way, I invite you to communicate this with me. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

## BOOKABLE OFFICE HOURS

-   You all enter this classroom with different sets of skills. In virtue of this fact, I open my office to you as an extension of the classroom. I am available for you during that time and if you can’t make it to the scheduled times, please let me know and together we will find a time which works.
-   There’s no incorrect way to approach office hours, and they can be as formal or informal as you would like. In this class, we will not shy away from difficult conversations and work closely together to cultivate a space of openness and mutual support. I welcome you to contact me outside of class and office hours through email.

## EQUIPMENT

You will need a relatively modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb). Limited numbers are available for checkout from the department. All software used within this class is free and widely available.

## TEACHING STYLE

Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, hands-on tutorials, homework review, presentations, and group work. You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop.

## GRADING

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

-   20% Participation
-   40% Assignments
-   20% Reading responses and other written work
-   20% Final project

## ASSIGNMENTS

There will be regular assignments that are relevant to the class material. These assignments include technical exercises, readings and written responses, and presentations.

In general, all assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording, code, and video all qualify based on the assignment) on the class assignment submission document. Each assignment is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete, an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted it may be marked partially complete. If an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Responses to reading and other written assignments are also due in class one week after they are assigned and must also be submitted via the class website. Written assignments are expected to be 150 to 300 words in length unless otherwise specified. Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.

## COMMUNICATION

You must check your email (or other stated class form of communication) for important updates about class.

## PARTICIPATION

ITP/IMA is committed to facilitating the fullest possible participation of all students. There are many forms of participation. Please communicate what kinds of engagement are best for you so it can be taken into account.

Examples of modes of participation can look like: asking questions, going to office hours, sending and reading emails, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, submitting responses to a form (anonymous or not), following instructions, active listening, etc.

## EXTENSIONS

An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension before the due date, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not request an extension, the grading rules above apply. Please clarify with your instructor and set a deadline together. The recommended timeline is 1 to 5 days.

Note: There may be instances where having an extension may result in not being able to participate fully in activities such as feedback sessions or workshopping ideas/projects, which likely cannot be made up if it could disrupt the overall course schedule. Extensions are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

## MAKEUP WORK POLICY

This is an option for those who have attended more than 50% of the class (if you have missed more than 50% of class sessions, it will result in an automatic F for the course). While there is no distinction in this course between excused and unexcused absences, you may inquire about makeup work. Makeup work could be content you can consume, a conversation with someone in class, additional office hours, writing a paper or an additional project. Not all course content can be made up. Please clarify with your instructor and set a deadline together. The recommended timeline is 1 to 5 days.

## INCOMPLETE GRADES

Incomplete grades may only be given to students who have completed more than half of the class assignments. Incomplete grades are given at the discretion of the professor.

## AI STATEMENT

You should treat AI tools just as you would any other source: cite the source and note how it was used (Harvard has a useful guide to citation of AIs). You should be prepared to explain how your use of it is the appropriate tool to fit your goal or concept and does not detract from your experience meeting the learning objectives of the assignment or course. There are some cases where the use of AI may fall under a form of plagiarism. Differentiate your work from your source’s work in a way that's clear to the reader or viewer. Additionally, you should be prepared to discuss the ethical concerns around the widespread use of emerging AI tools.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

After the first two weeks of the add/drop period, effective in week three onward, students are permitted a total of 2 absences.

There are no excused absences and unexcused absences. There are only absences. Any more than 2 absences will affect your grade. Two late arrivals (more than 10 minutes after start time) will count as 1 absence.

For example:
3 absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A
4 absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C instead of an A
5 absences will result in your highest possible grade being a D instead of an A
6 absences will result in an automatic F for the course

## STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.

## STATEMENT ON ACCESSIBILITY

It’s crucial for our community to create and uphold learning environments that empower students of all abilities. We are committed to create an environment that enables open dialogue about the various temporary and long term needs of students and participants for their academic success. We encourage all students and participants to discuss with faculty and staff possible accommodations that would best support their learning. Students may also contact the Moses Center for Student Accessibility (212-998-4980) for resources and support.

## STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Laptops and other electronic devices are essential tools for learning and interaction in classrooms. However, they can create distractions that hinder students' ability to actively participate and engage. Please be mindful of the ways in which these devices can affect the learning environment, please refrain from doing non-class oriented activities during class.

## STATEMENT ON TITLE IX

Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end, Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link:

## STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

Teachers and students work together to create a supportive learning environment. The educational experience in the classroom is one that is enhanced by integrating varying perspectives and learning modes brought by students.
