COURSE DESCRIPTION
------------------

The World Wide Web is a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards and extended into media posting and sharing. With the rise of broadband, more powerful computers, always on and connected mobile devices, synchronous or live communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conferencing and real-time chat give us the ability to create new forms of live interactive experiences for participants.

In this course, we’ll focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through web based and live interactive technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation. Specifically, we’ll look at new and emerging platforms on the web such as HTML5, WebSockets and WebRTC using p5.js, JavaScript and Node.js.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
-----------------

1.  Effectively build creative web applications that include working with real-time media
2.  Learn how to think about web application and real-time media system design as well as algorithmically; understand the process of breaking a task into discrete steps that a computer and/or user may employ to complete it.
3.  Think critically about the role of online media and technology in shaping individuals and society.

EQUIPMENT
---------

You will need a modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb).  Limited numbers are available for checkout from the department.  Commercial software required in the course will be made available on the laptops available for checkout.  Other required software is freely available.

ONLINE LIBRARY / ONLINE COURSE SUPPORT
--------------------------------------

Extensive online resources will be available on the [course website](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/liveweb-fall2023)

GRADING AND ATTENDANCE
----------------------

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

*   20% Participation
*   20% Regular Assignments
*   20% Presentation
*   15% Midterm Project
*   25% Final project

At most two unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two unexcused absences will result a lowering of your final grade by one fractional grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a A- instead of an A. Four unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B+ and so on. Two late arrivals of more than 10 minutes late will count for one absence.

Letter grades will be determined according to the following table:

*   A 93-100%
*   A- 90-92%
*   B+ 87-89%
*   B 83-86%
*   B- 80-82%
*   C+ 77-79%
*   C 73-76%
*   C- 70-72%
*   D+ 67-69%
*   D 63-66%
*   D- 60-62%
*   F Below 60%

PARTICIPATION
-------------

This class will be highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions, engage in group work, give feedback to your peers, and otherwise fully participate in class.

PHONE, TABLET, LAPTOP, AND OTHER ELECTRONICS USE
------------------------------------------------

Recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems and other devices are forbidden. Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.

TEACHING STYLE
--------------

Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, homework review, presentations, and group work. You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop and any other supplies specified for that class.

COURSE SCHEDULE
---------------

The course will be one time per week for three hours for a total of 14 weeks.

ASSIGNMENTS
-----------

There will be regular assignments that are relevant the class material. Each assignment is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing technical assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). to be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. if significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Responses to reading and other written assignments are also due in class one week after they are assigned and must be submitted via the class website. Written assignments are expected to be 200 to 500 words in length unless otherwise specified. Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Late (up to 1 week) or partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is more than a week late, not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.

TECHNICAL ASSIGNMENTS
---------------------

We will have assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class.

READING AND PRESENTATIONS
-------------------------

There will be assigned reading and student lead presentations and discussion. You are expected to do the reading and write a short (150 word) response on your blog in preparation for the discussion.

Starting on the 3rd week we’ll have student group (groups of 2 or 3 determined by the professor) projects.  You will be expected to present and have the class test a project utilizing the technology presented in previous class. Some ideas are to reimagine chat with emoji, develop a multiplayer game, put on a live interactive game show, and so on. The format should be a demonstration of what you built with the class participating in trying it out.

STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
-------------------------------

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

    COURSE DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    
    The World Wide Web is a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards and extended into media posting and sharing. With the rise of broadband, more powerful computers, always on and connected mobile devices, synchronous or live communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conferencing and real-time chat give us the ability to create new forms of live interactive experiences for participants.
    
    In this course, we’ll focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through web based and live interactive technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation. Specifically, we’ll look at new and emerging platforms on the web such as HTML5, WebSockets and WebRTC using p5.js, JavaScript and Node.js.
    
    COURSE OBJECTIVES
    -----------------
    
    1.  Effectively build creative web applications that include working with real-time media
    2.  Learn how to think about web application and real-time media system design as well as algorithmically; understand the process of breaking a task into discrete steps that a computer and/or user may employ to complete it.
    3.  Think critically about the role of online media and technology in shaping individuals and society.
    
    EQUIPMENT
    ---------
    
    You will need a modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb).  Limited numbers are available for checkout from the department.  Commercial software required in the course will be made available on the laptops available for checkout.  Other required software is freely available.
    
    ONLINE LIBRARY / ONLINE COURSE SUPPORT
    --------------------------------------
    
    Extensive online resources will be available on the [course website](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/liveweb-fall2023)
    
    GRADING AND ATTENDANCE
    ----------------------
    
    Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:
    
    *   20% Participation
    *   20% Regular Assignments
    *   20% Presentation
    *   15% Midterm Project
    *   25% Final project
    
    At most two unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two unexcused absences will result a lowering of your final grade by one fractional grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a A- instead of an A. Four unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B+ and so on. Two late arrivals of more than 10 minutes late will count for one absence.
    
    Letter grades will be determined according to the following table:
    
    *   A 93-100%
    *   A- 90-92%
    *   B+ 87-89%
    *   B 83-86%
    *   B- 80-82%
    *   C+ 77-79%
    *   C 73-76%
    *   C- 70-72%
    *   D+ 67-69%
    *   D 63-66%
    *   D- 60-62%
    *   F Below 60%
    
    PARTICIPATION
    -------------
    
    This class will be highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions, engage in group work, give feedback to your peers, and otherwise fully participate in class.
    
    PHONE, TABLET, LAPTOP, AND OTHER ELECTRONICS USE
    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Recreational use of phones, music players, video game systems and other devices are forbidden. Laptops and tablets are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.
    
    TEACHING STYLE
    --------------
    
    Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, homework review, presentations, and group work. You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop and any other supplies specified for that class.
    
    COURSE SCHEDULE
    ---------------
    
    The course will be one time per week for three hours for a total of 14 weeks.
    
    ASSIGNMENTS
    -----------
    
    There will be regular assignments that are relevant the class material. Each assignment is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.
    
    It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing technical assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.
    
    Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). to be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. if significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.
    
    Responses to reading and other written assignments are also due in class one week after they are assigned and must be submitted via the class website. Written assignments are expected to be 200 to 500 words in length unless otherwise specified. Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Late (up to 1 week) or partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is more than a week late, not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.
    
    TECHNICAL ASSIGNMENTS
    ---------------------
    
    We will have assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class.
    
    READING AND PRESENTATIONS
    -------------------------
    
    There will be assigned reading and student lead presentations and discussion. You are expected to do the reading and write a short (150 word) response on your blog in preparation for the discussion.
    
    Starting on the 3rd week we’ll have student group (groups of 2 or 3 determined by the professor) projects.  You will be expected to present and have the class test a project utilizing the technology presented in previous class. Some ideas are to reimagine chat with emoji, develop a multiplayer game, put on a live interactive game show, and so on. The format should be a demonstration of what you built with the class participating in trying it out.
    
    STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
    -------------------------------
