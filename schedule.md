    3. Modify the front end code (`public/index.html` and `public/sketch.js`) – adding any features or design/interactive elements you wish!

    *Not sure what to create?*  Try one of the following:
    * Add an image with every incoming chat message
    * Make the chat messages appear as leaves which fall after they arrive
    * Each incoming message displays in a different font and color.
    * Use a text [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) box instead of p5.js' `keyPressed()` function to get messages.
    * Use HTML `<p>` elements to display incoming messages using p5.js' [createP()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createP/) function or the JavaScript [createElement('p')](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) function
    * Make all of the messages spin in circles
    * Something else entirely...

## Week 3

- **Watch** this [supplemental video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NWgJhBXzZ-cc_c2irETyvLkd_5BLAht/view?usp=sharing) reviewing JS objects and arrays (you will need to be logged into Google Drive with your NYU email)
- **Collaborative Action** Remix the drawing application we began in class, adding in your own design / interaction elements.

    1. Login to your account on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) web-based code editor.
    2. Open [this glitch sketch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/f24-liveweb-drawing?path=public%2Fsketch.js%3A24%3A27) and press *Remix* to create your own copy.
    3. Modify the front end code (`public/index.html` and `public/sketch.js`) – adding any features or design/interactive elements you wish!  If you want to add an additional interaction, you may need to modify the server code (`server.js`).

    *Not sure what to create?*  Try one of the following:
    * Each peer's mouse hides or reveals an image, creating an interactive maze or a game of "I Spy"
    * Expand on the drawing example so each peer can change their color or brush size and clear the canvas.
    * Create 3D geometries using p5.js' WebGL mode
    * Paint using images!  Follow [this p5.js example](https://p5js.org/examples/imported-media-copy-image-data/) to learn more.

    - Following the examples from class, send a webcam image using websockets
    - Note that you might need to change the socket message handlers on the server in the server.js file

## Week 5 

### Objectives

-   Multi-user Live Audio/Video

### Outline

-   Design Exercise: examining existing applications
-   Midterm Project Discussion

### Assignments

-   Start to think about midterm project ideas!
-   On the class Miro board, detail a midterm project idea. Please make sure to touch on the concept and begin to explore how to make it. Remember that the goal of the midterm project to develop something of your own choosing using the techniques learned through the course thus far.  It should be similar in scope to a homework assignment (complete in 1 week).  It is possible to begin working on a larger project in which case the midterm should be dedicated to a proof of concept of the overall idea.  Think of it as a rough sketch rather than a painting or an outline instead of a paper.

## Week 6

### Objectives

-   Midterm Project Ideas

### Outline

-   Present and Discuss Midterm Project Proposals

-   Review Previous material as they relate to midterm projects

### Assignments

    -   Add your code for people around the world who want to do similar things.
    -   Describe where you would like to take this project, what more you would like to do with it.

- **Video Chat Exercise!** - Implement a video-chat app using WebRTC and p5LiveMedia
    - Expand on the code example from class to create a webcam enabled app for at least 3 participants using WebRTC and p5LiveMedia
    - You may choose how to place the incoming video feeds: randomly, in a grid, in a circle or use "WebGL" mode to place the participants in 3D space. 
    - Focus on the look and feel of your app - what is it which sets it apart from a standard video-conferencing solution.
    - Implement at least one of the following:
        - Participants can move their video feed around the canvas (and those changes are shown to other participants)
        - Participants can make their video feed larger or smaller (and those changes are shown to other participants)
        - App makes use of the entire window and all parts of the window are filled with some content.
        - Participants can also share drawings or animations
        - Each participants' video feed is displayed multiple times.
        - Something else?  Feel free to come up with your own fun video-chat ideas.
    - Be sure to document your video chat app on your blog.  Answer the following questions:
        - What did you try to implement and why?
        - Any design references or technical implementation references which you followed?  Cite your sources.

## Week 8

### Objectives

### Assignments

-   **Video Chat Part II** - Expand on your video chat from last week, incorporating Data Channels through p5LiveMedia.  Data Channels allow you to share data through WebRTC and can do many of the same things as websockets.  They have the advantage of being available in a peer-to-peer encrypted WebRTC connection, meaning that they are extremely private.  
     - Be sure to document your expanded video chat app on your blog.  Answer the following questions:
        - What did you try to implement and why?
